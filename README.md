# Surf Forecaster

This project is a Python-based surf forecasting tool that pulls real-time buoy and tide data from NOAA and converts it into practical surf conditions such as wave height, period, swell direction, wind, and water temperature. Using a weighted scoring approach, it ranks surf spots across Rhode Island and suggests an appropriate board type based on the conditions. Instead of presenting large amounts of raw data, the goal of this project is to give surfers a simple, straightforward answer about where to go and what to ride on a given day.

# Blackjack

This is a browser-based Blackjack game built with JavaScript and p5.js that includes betting, hit and stand functionality, animated card dealing, and basic dealer logic that follows standard Blackjack rules. The game uses multiple scenes to handle different stages of play and object-oriented structures to represent cards and buttons, allowing for smooth gameplay and user interaction.
